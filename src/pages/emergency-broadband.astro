        </p>

      <!-- What Was EBB -->
      <section class="mb-8">
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4" style="color: var(--color-primary)">What Was the Emergency Broadband Benefit?</h2>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
          The Emergency Broadband Benefit (EBB) was a temporary program that provided monthly discounts on internet service and devices during the COVID-19 pandemic. It offered up to $50 per month toward internet service and up to $75 per month for households on qualifying tribal lands.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">
          The EBB program officially ended on December 31, 2021, but it wasn't discontinued entirely. Instead, it evolved into the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP), which continued providing internet assistance until April 2024. Now, other programs like <strong>Free Government Phone</strong> services fill this gap by offering bundled phone and internet benefits.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- Transition to ACP -->
      <section class="mb-8">
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4" style="color: var(--color-primary)">From EBB to ACP and Beyond</h2>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
          When the Emergency Broadband Benefit transitioned to the Affordable Connectivity Program in January 2022, many participants automatically transferred to the new program. The ACP provided up to $30 monthly discounts on internet service and up to $75 for eligible tribal households.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">
          After the ACP ended in April 2024, many people wondered where to turn for internet assistance. Fortunately, wireless carriers and government phone programs stepped up to fill this need. Today's <strong>Free Government Phone</strong> programs often include substantial data allowances and hotspot capabilities, essentially providing free internet access through mobile networks.

          Getting your <strong>Free Government Phone</strong> through qualified programs means you receive both voice service and substantial data allowances. Many providers offer enough monthly data to handle video streaming, video calls, and web browsing without additional costs.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">
          Some carriers also provide discounted home internet options for existing government phone customers, creating multiple pathways to affordable connectivity. These bundled services ensure you stay connected whether you're at home or on the go.
