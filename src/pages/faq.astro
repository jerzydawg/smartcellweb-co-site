            You qualify if you participate in government assistance programs like SNAP (food stamps), Medicaid, WIC, SSI, Federal Housing Assistance, or Veterans Pension.

          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            No, you cannot have active phone service with another carrier when applying for a <strong>Free Government Phone</strong>. The program is designed to provide communication access to those who otherwise couldn't afford it. You must cancel your existing service before applying.
