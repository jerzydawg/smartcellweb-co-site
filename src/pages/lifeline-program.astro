      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        The Lifeline program makes it possible for millions of Americans to stay connected with family, employers, and emergency services. When you get a <strong>Free Government Phone</strong> through Lifeline, you receive both a smartphone and free monthly service that includes unlimited calling, texting, and data.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        This federal program removes the financial barrier that prevents low-income households from having reliable phone service. Your <strong>Free Government Phone</strong> works just like any other smartphone, giving you access to apps, internet browsing, and all the features you need to stay connected.

    <!-- What is Lifeline -->

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">What is the Lifeline Program?</h2>
      <div class="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-[var(--color-primary)] p-6 mb-6">
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">
          Lifeline is a government program that provides free phone service to qualifying low-income Americans. The program ensures that everyone has access to essential communication services, regardless of their financial situation.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Started in 1985, the Lifeline program has evolved to meet modern communication needs. Today, participants can choose between traditional landline service or a <strong>Free Government Phone</strong> with wireless service that includes data for internet access.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700">
        The program is funded through the Universal Service Fund, which means taxpayers don't directly pay for these services. Instead, telecommunications companies contribute to the fund, making free phones and service available to those who need them most.
